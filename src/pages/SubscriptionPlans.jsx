                Misuse of SOSE Elite membership or benefits of membership may
                result in termination of membership. In such a case SOSE Organic
                holds sole rights to terminate or withdraw some benefits for
                such users. Disqualification of a SOSE Elite member, arising out
                of his/her misconduct, fraud and misuse of benefits may result
                in termination of his/her membership and will not be eligible to
                become a member once again.

                Discounts are subject to a maximum capping for all users on the
                SOSE Organic platform. SOSE Elite members get a discount on
                products along with a higher maximum capping for these
                discounts, as compared to non-SOSE Elite users. The maximum
                capping at any given point in time is dependent on the platform
                offer that is live.
