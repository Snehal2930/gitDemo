        <Text pb={4} textAlign={"justify"}>
          Gaumata has been assigned tremendous significance in the Vedas and
          Ayurveda. Vedas state that the 'gavyas' (milk, curd, ghee, 'gomutra'
          and 'gomay') of 'santusht' (satisfied) and 'prasann' (happy) Gaumatas
          are 'kalyankari' (auspicious) and 'mangalkari' (beneficial). As stated
          in Ayurvedic texts, such 'gavyas' are highly beneficial to the body,
          and they help to multiply the healing qualities of medicinal herbs
          when processed appropriately.
